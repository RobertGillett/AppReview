The backup history could benefit from adding the time the power was lost. Also sometimes the notifications are not reaching us so looking into this should be good. Maybe a history of the notifications could be added. Last it would be good if the app could display the voltage coming from the grid. I presume this is measured so having it displayed would be good.

They will not return my calls or emails asking for clarification on why I was added to the final bill.\n\nTesla came out to my house two times to decide on a location for the powerwalls but during install they decided to put them somewhere else which I had not agreed to. What I learned was that Tesla does what they want and they do not want any input from the homeowner. \n\nTesla also broke my gutters with their ladders  but they will not return my calls to fix them. In their eyes the job is done.\n\nIn short, communication is non existent and they take weeks to reply to any question if they even reply at all.

Once. We. Get. In. See, one of the things that is sold is that you‚Äôll never have to take your keys out of your pocket to open or start it. You have a card for backup but your phone is the main key you use everyday. And it all sounded exciting. I heard about the new tech they were putting into cell phones allowing them to open cars. Until I realized.....(Palm slaps face and drags hand down, pulling down bottoms of lower eyelids) they made it a software feature instead of hardware like keyless entry/keyless start cars that every other car now has pretty much standard. How did they not see this coming? So what‚Äôs even more annoying that a Tesla cannot be geofenced to your home so that it will not auto-lock every time you leave it, as if you will never have to just grab something from your car real quick without your cellphone as it is parked in your garage, but a software upgrade to either my phone or the Model Y has prevented me from leaving my phone in my pocket to open the car about 75% of the time. Think about that. Having a set of keys is now easier to open your car then having to reach into your pocket, unlock your phone by code with your mask on, open the app and then press unlock on this app. Pretty advanced, huh? 65 thousand dollars for this model folks and we‚Äôve been rolling like this for about four months.

Same problem still exist, and this is a major issue. We just had 4 major power outages in the past 3 months and each time I never received notification that grid is off, so I used up most my battery during a snow storm when I could have conserved energy if I had gotten the notification. I really like Tesla products, but until they can get their act together and put out better customer support on their apps, phone calls, emails, etc,  I won‚Äôt be purchasing anything else from them anymore. This is really disappointing and unacceptable.\n\nI use this app mainly for my powerwalls. It‚Äôs nice to see live power usage on the app. Sometimes when our power goes out and powerwalls kick in, it doesn‚Äôt always notify me that it‚Äôs now using powerwalls even tho it was set in settings. This is important bc we frequently get outages over 14-16hrs and would be nice to know so we can conserve energy. It would also be nice to see the time power went out in the history instead of just showing how long it went out. Lately the energy usage chart doesn‚Äôt seem accurate. As I‚Äôm writing this our power is out (bc shown on PUD outage map plus all street lights,  neighbor house lights all out) but it‚Äôs showing normal consumption on app, not showing outage. Also, sometimes powerwall shows 0% left when in fact it‚Äôs fully charged. I expected more from Tesla esp after 2yr wait on the powerwalls and the price.","voteCount":0,"voteSum":0,"platform":"iOS","appID":"582007913","appName":"Tesla"},{"id":"7027581133","version":"3.10.9","date":"2021-02-23T03:10:31.000Z","authorName":"adamcnaglich","rating":2,"title":"It works, but it should be better","body":"The app is definitely of lower quality than the car.
